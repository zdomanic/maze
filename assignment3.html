<h1>CS2 Assignment 3: Data Structures</h1>
<h2>Due Tuesday, January 26, 2016, at 17:00 PST</h2>

<hr />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the CS2 assignment on data structures. In particular, you
will be handling binary search trees, queues, stacks, and quadtrees.</p>

<p>When finished, please enclose your submission as a ZIP file named
<span class="code">[NAME]-cs2week3.zip</span> or a tar.gz file named
<span class="code">[NAME]-cs2week3.tar.gz</span>, and upload it to the
Week 3 assignment module on Moodle.</p>

<h2>Assignment Background</h2>

<p>Data structures are ubiquitous in computer science, but not every data
structure is appropriate for every situation. Some common data structures
include queues, stacks, lists, sets, trees, etc. Tasks you might complete
using an appropriate data structure include organizing information, searching
information quickly, and sorting information. In this assignment, you will
be asked to use several data structures: binary search trees, stacks,
queues, and quadtrees.</p>

<h3>Maze solving with stacks and queues</h3>

<p>A <span class="keyword">stack</span> is a LIFO (last in, first out) data
structure that stores an ordered list of items. We commonly use two terms
to refer to how items are added to and removed from a stack:
<span class="keyword">push</span> and <span class="keyword">pop</span>.
When you push an item on a stack, you add it to the "top;" when you pop
an item off the stack, you remove it from the "top." Hopefully, you can
understand why this makes it a LIFO structure: the item that was just
pushed will be the first one to be popped.</p>

<p>In contrast, a <span class="keyword">queue</span> is a FIFO (first in,
first out) data structure that stores an ordered list of items. When you
remove an item from a queue, you <span class="keyword">dequeue</span> it,
whereas, when you add an item to a queue, you <span class="keyword">enqueue</span>
it. When items are enqueued, they are added to the "bottom" of the queue;
when they are dequeued, they are removed from the "top."</p>

<p>Though data structures are not generally interchangable, this
assignment will ask you to solve the same problem using two different
methods (and, therefore, two different data structures). Before you can
understand the search algorithms, you need some background on graphs.
<span class="hilite">Keep in mind that you will not be asked to implement
graphs in this assignment; you will complete an entire assignment on
graphs later in the term.</span> A graph, in short, is a set of
<span class="keyword">nodes</span> that are connected by
<span class="keyword">edges</span>, and each node contains some value.
Unlike trees, values in graphs <i>can</i> be repeated, and edges are two-way.
For this assignment, the graph will be a maze, where each node is an
open space, and its value will tell you which adjacent spaces are
accessible to it.</p>

<p>You will implement a depth-first search algorithm and a breadth-first
search algorithm. The processes involved in these two algorithms are
suggested by their names. A <span class="keyword">depth-first search</span>
searches a tree or graph by exploring a single branch as far as it can,
then backtracking to the last node with unvisited neighbors and repeating
the process. On the other hand, a <span class="keyword">breadth-first
search</span> searches a tree or graph by examining all the unvisited
neighbors of the current node; then, it examines all of <i>their</i>
neighbors, etc.</p>

<p>You might find it helpful to read the Wikipedia articles about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure)">stacks</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(data_structure)">queues</a>;
in particular, the animations may be helpful. You may also read
the articles on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first</a>
search algorithms before you attempt to implement them. Remember that
<i>all code you submit must be your own!</i>.</p>

<h3>Spatial data organization with quadtrees</h3>

<p>The quadtree is a data structure that allows us to store spatial
(two-dimensional) data in a convenient way. They are similar to
binary search trees, but each node of a quadtree contains up to <b>four</b>
children; a node can contain fewer than that. For our purposes, a
node can contain at most one point. If another point is inserted into
the tree and falls inside a node that already has a point, the tree
recursively divides that node into four children until no child
contains more than one point. Examine the figure below (credit:
Wikipedia) to be sure you understand this concept.</p>

<center>
<img src="images/quadtree.png" />
</center>

<p>You can clearly see that each region contains up to four children,
but many of them have three or two. This prevents us from needlessly
recursing and keeping up with regions where there are no points:
High-density areas will have more subdivided regions, and low-density
areas will have less.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p><ul>
	<li>g++ 4.6.x+</li>
	<li>libsdl1.2-dev</li>
	<li>libsdl-gfx1.2-dev</li>
</ul>

Ask a TA if you need help retrieving these packages, or if these packages
appear to be missing from the CS cluster.</p>

<h2>Assignment (20 points)</h2>

<div class="attention">At no point in this assignment should you use a
pre-built stack or queue class (such as those in STL); the whole point
of this assignment is that you learn how to implement these data
structures for yourself. If you are unsure if a resource is allowed, ask
a TA. In general, <span class="code">stdlib.h</span> and
<span class="code">stdio.h</span> should provide all the outside
functionality you will need.</div>

<p></p>

<div class="hint">Write all of your source code in the provided files,
leaving the file structure intact. Your submission should be your base
directory, zipped, with all source files included. You do not need to
include binaries or object files. To quickly remove binaries and object
files, run <span class="code">make clean</span> using the supplied
Makefile target. As always, be sure that the code you submit compiles!</div>

<h3>Part 0: Debugging with binary search trees</h3>

<p>This objective is to be completed inside the
<span class="code">bst</span> subdirectory. In the file
<span class="code">bst.cpp</span> there is a simple implementation
of a <span class="keyword">binary search tree</span>, a data structure that
facilitates searching for comparable items (integers in our case) in
<span class="code">O(log n)</span> time. Searching through linked lists is
inefficient because <span class="code">O(n)</span> nodes must be visited
on average; binary trees avoid the linear dependency by facilitating binary
search (where each decision eliminates half of the potential sample space).</p>

<p>When you run <span class="code">make bst</span>, you'll notice that this file
compiles to a binary called <span class="code">bst</span>. Running this binary
runs a quick test of the data structure, verifying that you can add numbers
successfully and then find them successfully in the data structure.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div> The current implementation is defective.
Identify why and fix it. Hint: there is at least one segmentation fault
and at least one memory leak.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Maze solving</h3>

<p>For this part, you will write two algorithms that will solve
a simple, randomly-generated maze. You will be implementing certain
functions from the classes described in the next few sections; you
should open them now and follow along with their descriptions so that
you understand the structure of this code. All source files are located
in <span class="code">maze/src</span>.</p>

<p>You have been provided a <span class="code">Coordinate</span> class
in <span class="code">maze/src/common.hpp</span>, a simple wrapper around
two integers representing zero-based maze coordinates. We have given you
two constructors and an assignment operator for this class to make it
easier to pass-by-value and return-by-value. It is worth your time to
study the provided code before you start!</p>

<h4>Part 1.1: CoordinateStack class</h4>

<p>The <span class="code">CoordinateStack</span> is a LIFO stack
that stores <span class="code">stackitem</span> structures, which
contain a <span class="code">Coordinate</span> object and a reference
to the next item in the stack. If you are already familiar with linked
lists, this design should not surprise you.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>This objective is to be completed
in <span class="code">maze/src/CoordinateStack.{cpp,hpp}</span>. You are
responsible for the following functions inside the
<span class="code">CoordinateStack</span> class. This class contains a
private pointer to the "top" stack item, <span class="code">top</span>,
since every <span class="code">stackitem</span> structure contains a
reference to the next item.</p>

<p><ul>
	<li><b><span class="code">init</span>:</b> This function should do
		any initialization you need for your implementation and should
		return nothing.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">deinit</span>:</b> This function should
		free any memory associated with stack items; we don't
		want any memory leaks!</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">do_push</span>:</b> This function takes
		a <span class="code">Coordinate</span> and pushes it onto the
        stack.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">do_pop</span>:</b> This function takes
        no arguments; it should remove the top
        <span class="code">Coordinate</span> from the stack and return
        it.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">peek</span>:</b> This function takes no
        arguments and returns the top <span class="code">Coordinate</span>
		<i>without removing it</i>.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">is_empty</span>:</b> This function takes
		no arguments; it returns <span class="code">true</span> if
		the stack has no items, <span class="code">false</span>
		otherwise.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Write a simple test sequence in
<span class="code">maze/src/testsuite.cpp</span> to demonstrate that
you can successfully push and pop <span class="code">Coordinate</span>
objects onto your stack. You should also demonstrate that you can
attempt to pop an item off an empty stack without causing a
segmentation fault, etc. Compile with
<span class="code">make testsuite</span>, and run with
<span class="code">bin/testsuite</span>.
Make sure in addition to printing values from your test, you print
brief descriptions of each value! Printing <span class="code">1 2</span>
is very hard to understand and is thus meaningless. Instead, print
something descriptive so the user can easily see whether the test
was passed.  For example, print
<span class="code">Popping Coordinate (1, 2). Popped value: 1 2</span>, where
the "(1, 2)" reports what you expect and the "popped value"
is what was actually popped.</p>

<div class="hint">Do not attempt to solve the maze with depth-first
search until you are sure your stack implementation works the way
you expect!</div>

<h4>1.2 Coordinate queue class</h4>

<p>The <span class="code">CoordinateQueue</span> is a FIFO queue that
stores <span class="code">queueitem</span> structures, which are
similar to <span class="code">stackitem</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>This objective is to be completed
in <span class="code">maze/src/CoordinateQueue.{cpp,hpp}</span>. You are
responsible for the following functions inside the
<span class="code">CoordinateQueue</span> class. This class contains a
private pointer to the "front" and "rear" stack item,
<span class="code">front</span> and <span class="code">rear</span>, so
that items can be added to the back of the queue and taken from the
front of the queue.</p>

<p><ul>
	<li><b><span class="code">init</span>:</b> This function should do
		any initialization you need for your implementation and should
		return nothing.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">deinit</span>:</b> This function should
		free any memory associated with queue items.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">do_enqueue</span>:</b> This function takes
		a <span class="code">Coordinate</span> object and enqueues
		it at the end of the queue.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">do_dequeue</span>:</b> This function takes
        no arguments; it should remove the front
        <span class="code">Coordinate</span> from the queue
		and return it.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">peek</span>:</b> This function takes no
        arguments and returns the front <span class="code">Coordinate</span>
        in the queue <i>without removing it</i>.</li>
	<li><b><span class="code">is_empty</span>:</b> This function takes
		no arguments; it returns <span class="code">true</span> if
		the queue has no items, <span class="code">false</span>
		otherwise.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>Continue your test sequence in
<span class="code">maze/src/testsuite.cpp</span> to demonstrate that
you can successfully enqueue and dequeue <span class="code">Coordinate</span>
objects into your queue. You should also demonstrate that you can
attempt to dequeue an item from an empty queue without causing a
segmentation fault, etc. Compile with
<span class="code">make testsuite</span>, and run with
<span class="code">bin/testsuite</span>.</p>

<div class="hint">Do not attempt to solve the maze with breadth-first
search until you are sure your queue implementation works the way
you expect!</div>

<h4>1.3 Depth-first search algorithm</h4>

<div class="quote">Compile the maze application with
<span class="code">make maze</span>, and run with
<span class="code">bin/maze</span>. Pressing 'b' will perform a
breadth-first search, and pressing 'd' will perform a depth-first
search; pressing 'r' resets the maze and 'q' quits.</div>

<p>The <span class="code">DepthFirstSolver</span> is a class that searches
a <span class="code">MazeGrid</span>, an array representation
of the maze, with a depth-first search. You will interact with the
<span class="code">MazeGrid</span> via its provided functions
and will not need to worry about writing it.</p>

<p>Now, you will use the <span class="code">CoordinateStack</span> class
to do something useful: solve a maze. The maze is rectangular, of
height <span class="code">HEIGHT</span> and width
<span class="code">WIDTH</span> (constants defined in the provided
code). All mazes begin at the coordinate position
<span class="code">(MAZE_START_X, MAZE_START_Y)</span> and end at coordinate
position <span class="code">(MAZE_END_X, MAZE_END_Y)</span>.
<span class="emph">All mazes have a solution.</span> Some general
pseudocode for the depth-first search algorithm is given below.</p>

<pre>
Push the first coordinate

while stack is not empty:
    Mark the current position as visited

    if current position is end coordinate:
        Stop the search
    else:
        Push the next available move onto the stack
</pre>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>This objective is to be completed
in <span class="code">maze/src/DepthFirstSolver.{cpp,hpp}</span>.
Implement the functions <span class="code">init</span>,
<span class="code">deinit</span>, and <span class="code">solve</span>.
<span class="code">solve</span>, which actually solves the maze, takes
a <span class="code">MazeGrid</span> object as its only argument. The
only thing you should do with the <span class="code">MazeGrid</span> is
call its <span class="code">get_possible_moves</span> function, which
takes integers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> representing a valid position and
returns an integer that is some bitwise OR-d combination of four constants:
<span class="code">N</span>, <span class="code">S</span>,
<span class="code">E</span>, and <span class="code">W</span> (representing
the directions north, south, east, and west, respectively). Below is
an example of testing if east is a valid move from the position (1, 2).</p>

<pre class="prettyprint code">
res = grid->get_possible_moves(1, 2);

if (res & E)
{
	/* We can move east from (1, 2). */
	do_something();
}
else
{
	/* We cannot move east from (1, 2). */
	do_something_else();
}
</pre>

<p>The skeleton class you are given includes a private member
<span class="code">stack</span>, a pre-initialized
<span class="code">CoordinateStack</span> object; you should use this
stack instead of allocating your own. In addition, you are provided the
member <span class="code">visited</span>, an array of boolean values to
help you keep up with which squares you have already visited.
You are free to modify, remove, and add variables to your class.</p>

<p>You are perfectly welcome to break up your solving function into
smaller pieces by writing helper functions; this should also make
debugging your code easier. You may or may not use all of the functions
you implemented in your <span class="code">CoordinateStack</span> class,
but remember that all of them are available to you.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>To be able to visualize your maze-solving
procedure, you must also implement the member function
<span class="code">get_path</span>, which returns the current path through
the maze. The renderer will call this function after push and pop operations
to update the display and show you the current state. You may want to add
another function to the stack class to help you; remember that, for DFS,
the entire path is contained on the stack. Your implementation of this
function should not call or rely on <span class="code">push()</span> or
<span class="code">pop()</span> functions.</p>

<h4>1.4 Breadth-first search algorithm</h4>

<div class="quote">Compile the maze application with
<span class="code">make maze</span>, and run with
<span class="code">bin/maze</span>. Pressing 'b' will perform a
breadth-first search, and pressing 'd' will perform a depth-first
search; pressing 'r' resets the maze and 'q' quits.</div>

<p>The <span class="code">BreadthFirstSolver</span> is a class that
searches a <span class="code">MazeGrid</span> with a
breadth-first search. You will interact with the
<span class="code">MazeGrid</span> via its provided functions
and will not need to worry about writing it.</p>

<p>The parameters of the maze are the same for the
<span class="code">BreadthFirstSolver</span> class. Some general
pseudocode for the breadth-first search algorithm is given below. You
should take note of the similarities and differences between the two
algorithms and their corresponding data structures.</p>

<pre>
Enqueue the first coordinate

while queue is not empty:
    Mark the current position as visited

    if current position is end coordinate:
        Stop the search
    else:
        Enqueue all available moves
</pre>

<p><div class="points easy">2</div>This objective is to be completed
in <span class="code">maze/src/BreadthFirstSolver.{cpp,hpp}</span>. Again,
implement the functions <span class="code">init</span>,
<span class="code">deinit</span>, and <span class="code">solve</span>.
This function takes the same arguments as that in the
<span class="code">DepthFirstSolver</span> class, a pointer to a
<span class="code">MazeGrid</span> object representing the maze to be
solved, and you can test for available moves in the same way that was
demonstrated above.</p>

<p>As before, the skeleton class you are given includes a private member
<span class="code">queue</span>, a pre-initialized
<span class="code">CoordinateQueue</span> object; you should use this
queue instead of allocating your own. You are again provided the
member array <span class="code">visited</span>, but with some extra
sugar. Unlike DFS, the path through the maze found via BFS is not
contained in the queue, so you not only need to keep up with which
squares you have already visited but also <i><b>how you got there</b></i>.
The <span class="code">visited</span> is an array of structures that
contain both a boolean (has this square been visited?) and a
<span class="code">Coordinate</span> (how did we get here?).
You are free to modify, remove, and add variables to your class.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>To be able to visualize your maze-solving
procedure, you must also implement the member function
<span class="code">get_path</span>, which returns the current path through
the maze. The renderer will call this function after enqueue operations
to update the display and show you the current state. This time, you
have all the information you need stored in the
<span class="code">visited</span> member array and should not require a
helper function in your queue class. Again, it would be in your best
interest to avoid using <span class="code">enqueue()</span> and
<span class="code">dequeue()</span> functions.</p>

<h4>1.5 Analysis</h4>

<p><div class="points easy">1</div>In a text file called
<span class="code">README</span> in the <span class="code">maze</span>
subdirectory, explain the conditions under which one search algorithm
(from the set {BFS, DFS}) may be faster than the other. Give one
"real-life" example of using/task that can be accomplished with a stack,
and another example of using/task that can be accomplished with a queue.
Maze solving doesn't count &mdash; try to think of something new!</p>

<h3>Challenge problem: Quadtrees</h3>

<div class="attention">Objectives in this section are intended to
be challenging and may take longer than the others. Attempt this
section only if you have the time!</div>

<p></p>

<div class="quote">Compile the quadtree application by running
<span class="code">make quadtree</span>, and run it with
<span class="code">bin/quadtree</span>. Clicking inside the window
issues a query, of which you will see a graphical representation.
Press 'a' to add 50 more points to the tree, 'r' to reset, and 'q'
to quit.</div>

<p><div class="points hard">5</div>You have been provided a simple
quadtree visualizer application and stripped source files in the
<span class="code">quadtree</span> subdirectory. Fill in the quadtree
base and node classes, found in <span class="code">quadtree/src/Quadtree.{cpp,h}</span> and
<span class="code">quadtree/src/QuadtreeNode.{cpp,h}</span>, to correctly implement
a quadtree. We are not giving you much guidance on this section on
purpose; reading the provided function headers would be helpful! We have
only included the "bare minimum" functions your classes should implement;
feel free to add others.</p>
